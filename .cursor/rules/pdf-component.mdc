# PDF Component Guide

The [PDFComponent.tsx](mdc:app/smart-cv-analysis/PDFComponent.tsx) is a React component that handles PDF file uploads and text extraction. Here's how it works:

## State Management
- `file`: Stores the selected PDF file
- `isLoading`: Tracks the upload/extraction process
- `error`: Handles error messages
- `extractedText`: Stores the extracted text from the PDF

## Key Functions
1. `handleFileChange`: Validates and sets the selected PDF file
2. `handleUpload`: Handles the file upload and text extraction process

## API Integration
The component communicates with `/api/extract-pdf` endpoint to process PDFs. The endpoint expects:
- Method: POST
- Body: FormData with a 'file' field containing the PDF

## UI Elements
- File input for PDF selection
- Upload button with loading state
- Error message display
- Extracted text display area

## Error Handling
The component handles various error cases:
- Invalid file type (non-PDF)
- Upload failures
- API processing errors
